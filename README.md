# Plan for project
The project I’m making will allow users to see sports update, live watching and weather forecasting every moment. This app will have very little stored data, but relies on different APIs.

I followed these basic steps to create a site plan:
1.	Define the goals and objectives of my site.
2.	Create a wireframe.
3.	Organize my content and create a content list.
4.	Create a task list.
Visualize what I need to do at every stage of the site creation process. Then break that down into tasks that need to be accomplished. Note whether a task is dependent on the completion of an earlier one. This list helps me estimate how long the project will take and the resources needed.
5.	Set a timeline.
Using task list from the previous step, I estimate the time it will take to accomplish each task. I always Keep in mind that the creative process is rarely problem-free; I need to allow a reasonable amount of time for unforeseen problems, such as having my site-rendering technology take longer than I think. Setting a timeline helps me guide the process and enables you to change plans if needed.      
**week 12: I will complete   Backend**         
**week 13: I will finish homepage**     
**week 14: Upgrade homepage's frontend and backend**       
**week 15: Design backend for whole project and learn advance backend**      
**week 16: Apply backend in front page and other few pages**
